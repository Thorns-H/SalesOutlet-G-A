# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Outlet

This is the first project i've ever made using tkinter, thanks to [SadGabo](https://github.com/sadgabo) for giving me the idea.
The UI text and everything is written in spanish, also, this program only works on Windows.

Basically, you can register a product, the price and the hour when somebody purchases something an put it into a file, you can find the list of products right [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_8todsvzfPaC7pNttezEl6o5wwJ1NdVS/view?usp=sharing)

## To Run
